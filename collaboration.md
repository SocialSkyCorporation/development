# Collaboration

We're building a globally distributed technology company. That means we're going to be remote first 
and will need to invest in the tools for collaboration.

## Overview

The current tools we use

- [Discussion](https://slack.micro.mu) - We use **Slack** as our community channel for real time discussion
- [Development](https://github.com/micro/development) - We use **GitHub** for code, design docs and knowledge share
- [Video Calls](https://zoom.us/) - We use Zoom or related for team calls
