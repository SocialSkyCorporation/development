# Collaboration

We're building a globally distributed technology company. That means we're going to be remote first 
and will need to invest in the tools for that.

## Overview

- [Community](https://micro.mu/community) - We use **Slack** as our community channel for real time discussion
- [Development](https://github.com/micro/development) - We use **GitHub** for code, design docs and knowledge share

We will add more to the list as needed.

Tools to be considered

- Monday.com - for project tracking
- Notion.so - for long form content
- Zoom - for video conferencing
