# Evolution

Micro is company, product and project which follows an evolutionary architecture.

## Overview

Nothing in the world is static and neither is Micro. Where we started life as a simple Go framework 
for microservices development, we have expanded the scope of our ambitions to become a platform 
for Micro services development. Where we were originally 1 person, we are many more. Micro 
continues down this path of evolution, to adapt, survive, thrive and become something bigger 
in the world.

## Design

The design of an evolutionary architecture is one which is continuously able to adapt either 
through iteration or more conscious ground breaking rebuilds. We welcome new modes of operation 
based on our experiences within the technology and the company. When something no longer 
feels like its working we look to adapt and change.

Micro is solving one problem today but a year from now, five years from now, we may be 
solving very different problems. Our goal is to continually build on our own foundations 
to enable a future that lets developers create without friction or limitation.

## Goals

Primarily the goal of evolution is to survive. We are no different. As a project, product and 
company we want to survive. We only have limited time and money to execute on our opportunity. 
If we become a self sustaining entity and one which provides real value in the world then 
we will likely not only survive but thrive.
