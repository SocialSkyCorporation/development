# Personal Growth and Development

Micro is as much about a personal journey of evolution as it is about the collective mission. Every person 
working on or with Micro should feel like they're growing and evolving, continually being challenged and 
going in the direction that makes sense for them.

Sometimes this means outgrowing Micro but other times it means finding and playing to our strengths as 
they change over time. Micro, the company, empowers developers and the employees of the company to buy 
into that change.

## Growth

We don't remain static as human beings and over time we require new challenges. This needs to be driven 
both by ourselves and the environment which we spend the majority of our time. It is first and foremost 
import to understand when personal growth is stalling and to then identify how we want to adapt and 
continue to evolve. Based on that we can align ourselves with the company's mission and take on new 
challenges.

## Development

Personal development is more than just growth. Growth is a natural evolutionary process that occurs 
via both internal and external factors but without nurturing that we can stunt it and not quite 
thrive as we want.

Development is about taking the time to invest in things that will keep us growing. This can mean 
taking a step back, taking time off, switching tasks, spending time doing research, hacking on 
fun orthogonal or non-related projects. Basically the key is to use a gut instinct about where 
and how we want to spend our time while also building in an opportunity to continue to learn.

An example of that is hack days. Hack days enable us to do something different, to push the boundaries 
in ways we wouldn't get the chance to otherwise do. Another completely unrelated example is to 
take a week to educate ourselves on current world issues considering everything we do is not done 
in isolation.

## Notes

This sounds like a very out of scope piece of text for developers or a development repo but is in fact 
highly relevant considering the success of any product, project or mission is driven by human beings.
