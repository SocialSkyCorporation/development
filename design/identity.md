# Identity

This is the design doc for service identity

## Overview

Service identity is at the core of our runtime. Every service has a given name, but an identity is verifiable 
and can be traced to the root of the creator of that service. We propose to create an identity system that 
is bootstrapped from the ground up based on public/private keypair and verified by the runtime and auth services.
