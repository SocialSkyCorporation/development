# Ideas

This directory serves as the place for new ideas and ideation.

## Overview

A lot of the times we have ideas that we want to start working on our flesh out but they're not really 
in a place to be added to the core codebase. Ideas serves as a place to collectively share and work 
on new ideas so that we can iteratively move through a space before even writing a line of code.

## Major Ideas

Some of the major ideas

- [wasm](wasm.md) - A wasm runtime will enable true ubiquity and deployment everywhere
- [voice](voice.md) - Processing voice commands like an api request is the next entrypoint
- [clients](clients.md) - Multi language clients will allow Micro to proliferate broadly across other domains
- [routing](routing.md) - Label and weight based routing which enables feature testing and dynamic routing
- [trust](trust.md) - Reputation based scoring of services to get a better understanding of quality of service
- [language](language.md) - A new type of emergent language built on top of services as a DSL of sorts
