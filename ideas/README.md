# Ideas

This directory serves as the place for new ideas and ideation.

## Overview

A lot of the times we have ideas that we want to start working on our flesh out but they're not really 
in a place to be added to the core codebase. Ideas serves as a place to collectively share and work 
on new ideas so that we can iteratively move through a space before even writing a line of code.
