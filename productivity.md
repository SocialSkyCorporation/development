# Developer Productivity

Often when we're solving complex tasks in micro it can be difficult to make progress in one aspect. 
Over the years we've noticed that having 3 tasks going in parallel is a great way to continually 
make incremental progress in each and also avoid burning out.

We're driving a requirement that anyone work on micro development be juggling 3 things at any time. 
There is no requirement for all 3 to be coding. We expect a variety of tasks e.g library, blog post, 
tutorial, services, etc.

## Tasks

Types of tasks/work that we need to be working on:

- **Framework** - the core library abstractions
- **Runtime** services - the micro platform services
- **Network** services - the high level services in the network
- **Blog** - interesting microservices related posts
- **Docs** - documentation to improve usage experience
- **Bugs** - fixing existing issues
- **Perf** - optimising the tools

We'll maintain a list of [GH cards](https://github.com/micro/development/projects/2) for existing tasks.
