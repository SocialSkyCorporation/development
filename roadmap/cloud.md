# Cloud

Cloud is infrastructure management as a service. 

## Overview

Cloud infrastructure management is a pain and Kubernetes as the abstraction for the cloud is a lie. 
There are still per environment quirks that must be dealt with and the overhead of per env management 
is painful. Cloud attempts to solve these problems as a service that understand how each 
cloud provider operates.
