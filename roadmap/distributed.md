# Distributed

**Distributed** is a collaboration tool for distributed teams and the first product we're building on the platform.

## Overview

Our goal is to dogfood our own product through and through. To do this we need to build products on the 
platform. Because our team is going fully distributed we'll ultimately need collaboration tools to enable 
that experience. Right now we have a disparate set of tools to do this. 

**Distributed** is a collaboration tool for distributed teams powered by Micro.

## Features

The Distributed service includes the following features:

- Live streaming (video and audio)
- Messaging, comments and threads
- TODO, notes, reminder sharing/tracking
- Screen sharing
- ... more to come

## Design

Distributed is designs as a Micro services product with services themselves defined by their domain boundaries.

- Streaming
- Messaging
- Reminders
- ...

Distributed is built on the M3O platform
