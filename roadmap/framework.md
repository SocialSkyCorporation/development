# Framework

Go Micro is a framework for microservices development.

## Overview

Go Micro is an open source framework for microservices and distributed systems development in Go. 
It's the most popular and dominant framework for cloud based development in Go. It was open source 
in 2015 and its primary focus is to simplify microservices development via strongly defined 
abstractions and pluggable interfaces.

Think Rails for Ruby and Spring for Java.
