# Network

The network is a marketplace to buy, sell and share services

## Overview

Micro Services, Inc. is a services company. We are defining a new way of building services for the Cloud. 
This is driven by the Micro Framework, Runtime and now Platform. Where there currently exists Android 
and iOS for mobile, we're yet to see a standard for the Cloud. Micro is that standard.

The marketplace offers a similar opportunity as the App Store and Play Store to buy, sell and share 
Micro services to run on the M3O platform or a self-hosted version of it.

## Features

The marketplace offers the following:

- Publish services to the marketplace
- Buy, sell or share services that are available
- Search for and explore services and their APIs
- Host or reuse services on the M3O platform
- Self-host install of services

## Commercialisation

The marketplace will offer the ability to share services for free consumption or to be sold in 
a variety of transactional models. In the beginning we will only support flat fee subscription 
and Micro itself will take 30% commission for any services sold.

Services can be hosted on the M3O platform. We will charge an additional subscription premium 
to either the buyer or seller depending on what their needs are.

## Branding

The marketplace will be called "Network" as marketplaces are effectively networks. The word marketplace has also become something of a useless term that no one actually gravitates towards. People feel it cheapens their experience and they are immediately in the mind set of being sold to. A "Network" is to be part of something and considering this creates a new services economy it is fitting.

## Placement

The "Network" will be a tab in the m3o dashboard alongside Projects and Services. 

- Projects - are a users own services they are creating
- Services - are services installed by or shared with the user
- Network - is the marketplace where they can buy, sell and share services
