# Product Roadmap

This is the product and business related roadmap which differs from the technical roadmap.

## Overview

Micro is effectively a developer first focused product. Our primary goal is to enable developers 
to build, share and collaborate on microservices. We do this via an open source Go framework 
and ultimately our end product, a serverless platform for microservices development.
