# Spatial

Spatial is a spatial computing platform for AR.

## Overview

Spatial is a spatial computing platform built on Micro for AR, Gaming and any devices on the network. 
Spatial is a platform beyond the platform, a world in which all services, devices and data live on 
the edge. Where our interactions are fundamentally different. Spatial operates on the premise 
that literally everything in the network is a Micro service; with a name, address, metadata.
