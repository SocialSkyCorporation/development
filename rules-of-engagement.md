# Rules of engagement

Rules of engagement are a model of operation within Micro

## Overview

We use rules of engagement to determine how we actually make decisions autonomously and what otherwise requires higher 
level authority or consensus. In the majority of cases we should be able to make decisions independently and only require 
higher level authority where it's an irreversible decision or one that has high impact. 

For the most part this should accelerate the delivery of any objective and enable us to work with a higher degree of freedom 
to ultimately execute on the mission of the company.

## Mission

Our mission is to be the fastest way to build, share and collaborate on services.

## Rule 1: Do not ask, just do

Most of the time we know what we're doing, we know what to deliver, we have the insights and the gut instinct to do so. 
It just makes sense to get on with it. Often the first attempt is not right but all things work through thousands of 
iterations. Things can always be changed or fixed.

## Rule 2: When in doubt, shout

If you hesitate to make a decision or know it might require more than your own decision making power, now is the time to 
do something about it. Consult your peers, get the thumbs up, the +1 and keep moving. If need be get a discussion going, 
hop on a call, whatever it takes to resolve the issue.

## Rule 3: Engage when mission critical

When you know it's something of high impact that affects the mission or could have profound impact on the direction of the 
mission, this is the time to get consensus or higher level authority. The mission is the most important thing above all else 
and all things should be laser focused through a funnel so that we're always firing in a straight line.
