# Wishlist

A wish list of things we really want to build but just don't have time for right now.

## Overview

The wish list is stuff we really want to build but we need to push out to the future. It might be things we 
do on hack days or just things we revisit at a later date. Its a good place for ideas with full knowledge 
that its not our priority.

## The List

- developers.micro.mu - a portal for interactive tutorials and learning
- `micro env clone [env-from] [env-to]` - I want to be able to deploy my local app with one command to an other env. Env setup must be similarly simmple 1 command solution (`micro env create`)
